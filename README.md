## Overview

This monorepo project is designed to generate personalized newsletters through AI algorithms. It is composed of frontend and backend subsystems. The backend is architected in a Node.js environment and leverages Prisma for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). The frontend is constructed using React and integrates Auth0 for secure authentication.

## Backend

### Database Schema

### Database Schema Relationships

This section elaborates on the relationships and constraints among the database modelsâ€”User, Newsletter, UsedArticle, and ContentHistory.

#### Models and Fields

1. **User**: Represents an end-user in the system.

   - `id`: Unique identifier generated as a UUID.
   - `userEmail`: Unique email for the user.
   - `name`: Optional name.
   - `newsletters`: Array linking to newsletters authored by the user.
   - `emailsToSendTo`: JSON field containing additional email addresses.

2. **Newsletter**: Represents a newsletter.

   - `id`: Unique identifier, auto-incremented.
   - `regenerateCount`: Counter for regeneration attempts, defaulting to zero.
   - `title`, `content`, `sentDate`, `userId`, `topic`, `reason`, `searchQuery`: Various attributes.
   - `contentHistory`: Array linking to a history of contents.
   - `usedArticles`: Array linking to articles used in the newsletter.
   - `user`: Foreign key relation to the `User` who authored the newsletter.

3. **UsedArticle**: Represents articles used in newsletters.

   - `id`: Unique identifier, auto-incremented.
   - `url`, `newsletterId`, `createdAt`, `userId`, `topic`, `reason`: Various attributes.
   - `newsletter`: Foreign key relation to the `Newsletter` in which the article was used.

4. **ContentHistory**: Represents the historical content for newsletters.
   - `id`: Unique identifier, auto-incremented.
   - `newsletterId`, `content`, `createdAt`: Various attributes.
   - `newsletter`: Foreign key relation to the `Newsletter` with which the content is associated.

#### Relationships

1. **User -> Newsletter**: One-to-Many  
   A User can author multiple Newsletters, but each Newsletter is authored by one User.

2. **Newsletter -> ContentHistory**: One-to-Many  
   A Newsletter can have multiple entries in ContentHistory, but each ContentHistory entry belongs to one Newsletter.

3. **Newsletter -> UsedArticle**: One-to-Many  
   A Newsletter can reference multiple UsedArticles, but each UsedArticle is used in one Newsletter.

4. **Composite Uniqueness in UsedArticle**:  
   The combination of `url`, `userId`, `topic`, and `reason` in the `UsedArticle` model is required to be unique, as defined by the `@@unique` directive.

#### Constraints

1. **Cascade Delete**:  
   If a Newsletter is deleted, all corresponding entries in `UsedArticle` and `ContentHistory` are also deleted due to the `onDelete: Cascade` constraint.

2. **Field Defaults**:  
   Various fields have default values specified, such as `@default(uuid())`, `@default(autoincrement())`, `@default(0)`, and `@default(now())`.

3. **Uniqueness and IDs**:  
   Fields like `userEmail` in the `User` model and the composite keys in `UsedArticle` ensure data integrity through their uniqueness constraints.

### Core Functionalities

#### Prisma Client (`prismaClient.ts`)

- `importEmailList`: Bulk imports email addresses for a designated user.
- `addSingleEmail`: Appends a singular email to a user's email list.

#### Data Processing (`dataprocessing.ts`)

- `isArticleUsed`: Validates whether an article has been previously used.
- `processArticles`: Filters articles based on a given search query.
- `sortArticles`: Ranks articles according to their relevance and rationale.

### Server Implementation (`server.ts`)

The server is implemented using Express.js and is configured to run on a port specified in the environment variables or defaults to 3001. It uses Prisma as the ORM and AWS SES for email services.

#### Middleware

- `express.json()`: For parsing JSON request bodies.
- `cors`: For handling CORS issues.

#### Server Initialization

The server is initialized to listen on the specified port and logs a message to the console confirming the same.

### API Endpoints

The server exposes several RESTful API endpoints for various functionalities:

- `GET /unsubscribe`: Handles unsubscription requests.
- `POST /api/update-user`: Updates user information.
- `POST /api/create-newsletter`: Creates a new newsletter.
- `GET /api/get-newsletters`: Fetches all newsletters for a user.
- `GET /api/get-emails`: Fetches all emails for a user.
- `POST /api/delete-selected-emails`: Deletes selected emails.
- `DELETE /api/delete-newsletter/:id`: Deletes a newsletter by ID.
- `POST /api/add-emails`: Adds emails to a user's list.
- `POST /api/send-newsletter`: Sends the newsletter.
- `POST /api/regenerate-newsletter`: Regenerates the content of a newsletter.

### AI Integration

- `generateOptimalBingSearchQuery`: Constructs an optimized Bing search query.
- `generateSummaryWithGPT`: Summarizes articles using GPT algorithms.
- `generateNewsletterWithGPT`: Fabricates the newsletter content via GPT.

## Frontend

### Dependencies (`package.json`)

- Libraries: React, Auth0, Emotion (Styling), Material-UI (UI Components)

### Core Functionalities

#### App Component (`app.jsx`)

- Manages authentication and routes users to the pertinent component.

#### API Service (`apiservice.js`)

- Offers utility functions for backend API communication.

#### Authenticated App (`authenticatedapp`)

- Oversees the authenticated segment of the application.

### UI Components

- `ConfirmDeleteDialog`: Confirmation dialog for delete operations.
- `ConfirmSendDialog`: Confirmation dialog for send operations.
- `EmailList`: Manages and displays the email list.
- `LoginButton`: Executes user login.
- `LogoutButton`: Executes user logout.
- `NewsletterDetailDialog`: Shows detailed newsletter information.
- `NewsletterForm`: Provides a form interface for newsletter creation.
- `NewsletterList`: Manages and displays the list of newsletters.

## Environment Variables (`auth0-config.json`)

- Auth0 configurations for authentication are stored here.

## External Services

- **Bing Search API**: Responsible for article retrieval based on search queries.
- **AWS SES**: Utilized for email dispatch.

## Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`: URL for the PostgreSQL database.
- `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS SES settings.
- `BING_API_KEY`: API key for Bing Search.
- `GPT_API_KEY`: API key for GPT.
